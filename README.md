# Factor-risk-model-with-principal-component-analysis
<p align="justify">In this repository, principal component analysis (PCA) is used on price time series of assets/securities to give an underlying composition into those of some selected risk factors price timeseries. In this example, we use different indexes tracking the NASDAQ, EUROSTOXX50, HSI or different bond markets to track a global market of different securities. Their price timeseries define a statistical risk model.</p>

<p align="justify">To elaborate further, the use of the PCA technique enables the formulation of statistical model factors (principal explanatory component, in this case) by clustering securities in sets in order to maximize asset return correlation within the cluster. At the same time, the clustered securities will have negligible correlations with the rest of the securitiesâ€™ returns, thus enabling the derived factors to capture maximum risk.</p>

## Getting Started

<p align="justify">These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.</p>

### Prerequisites

<p align="justify">You need Python 3.x to run the following code.  You can have multiple Python versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems. Python needs to be first installed then SciPy</p>.

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

Alongside Python, the SciPy packages are also required. In Ubuntu and Debian, the SciPy ecosystem can be installed by:

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose

For getting the data of price timeseries, we use the yfinance package that can be installed using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a> package manager:

    pip install yfinance

For more information on the packages and their installation process, check the below links:

http://www.python.org/getit/ for Python    
https://www.scipy.org/install.html for the SciPy ecosystem    
https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/ for the yfinance module 


### File descriptions
<ul>
    <li><p align="justify">"<em>Univariate_analysis_classic_methods.ipynb</em>" in which the univariate time series analysis using ARIMA and SARIMA models is carried out. A rolling forward window approach (walk-forward validation) is used on a weekly period to forecast the price of the currency on the next week.</p></li>
    
<li><p align="justify">"<em>Grid_search_models_hyperparameters.ipynb</em>" shows a procedure to find the best hyperparameters for the ARIMA and SARIMA models, for the time series analysis approach used in the file above.</p></li>

</ul>

### Running the files

<p align="justify">Both notebooks can directly be opened on GitHub. Alternatively, you can also use the Jupyter Notebook. This can be done by executing the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):</p>

    jupyter notebook

<p align="justify">This will print some information about the notebook server in your terminal, including the URL of the web application (by default, http://localhost:8888):</p>

    $ jupyter notebook
    [I 11:47:00.830 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: C:\Users\EC-PM-3
    [I 11:47:00.830 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
    [I 11:47:00.830 NotebookApp] http://localhost:8888/?token=d22181d47f4826316a37161bb8c8469d77a5851bf9ab2c1f
    [I 11:47:00.830 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).

It will then open your default web browser to this URL.

<p align="justify">When the notebook opens in your browser, you will see the Notebook Dashboard, which will show a list of the notebooks, files, and subdirectories in the directory where the notebook server was started. The notebook can then be chosen by navigating in the Notebook Dashboard.</p>

<p align="justify">For more information on how to run a specific jupyter notebook, you can go to the <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running">following link</a>.</p>
